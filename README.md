## Java GUI for Updating and Deleting Rows
This project aims to make the adding and deleting of items much more easier wth the help of the swing GUI builder. The code is open source and there is a lot to be made. I look forward to making the add Row feature possible. 
## Getting Started

Make sure the jars in the `lib` folder are added to your dependecies in this project

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
